# hackharbor.

"HackHarbor is a comprehensive full-stack web platform for cybersecurity training that combines fundamental basic learning to advance with hands-on practice. It features an Academy with structured modules, alongside a practical lab where users can ethically hack into vulnerable machines and learn how to perform defensive against attacks. Each of these machines is securely isolated as a Docker container within a VPN-controlled environment.

  The platform is powered by a React frontend and a FastAPI backend, which handles user authentication, machine orchestration, and a real-time flag submission and scoring system. For streamlined deployment, the entire application is containerized using Docker Compose."
